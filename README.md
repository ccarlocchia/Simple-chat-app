# Simple-chat-app


## Simple chat app I'm creating to learn how to do one.

---

I'm using Django framework and followed part of this tutorial: [How To Build A Realtime Chat App With Django](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpAk1Eu52GU).

For the styling this codepen was really helpful: [Log In Form CSS 2017](https://codepen.io/linux/pen/LLVaqx)

## How to run local:

1. Create a virtual environment and activate it. `virtualenv venv` + `source venv/bin/activate`
2. Install requirements by running on you console: `pip install -r requirements.txt` .
3. Go inside de chatapp folder `cd chatapp` .
4. Run `./manage.py runserver` .

It will run on port 127.0.0.1:8000.

If you have trouble running it check django documentation about manage.py file â†’ [django-admin and manage.py](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/django-admin/)
